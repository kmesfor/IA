For the program to properly function, the following files must exist or be created:
- Directory: data/ --- A data folder must be created in the same directory as the "src/" directory. The program will create and manage files within the directory
- File: credentials.txt --- A file containing the username and password to log into the program. The first line is the username, with the password on the next line

Example file structure:
src/
	org.candidates.ibo.kgb197.tutormanagement/
		components/
			...
		datatypes/
			...
		popups/
			...
		...
data/
	...
credentials.txt
